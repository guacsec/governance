## Agenda

* Welcome new friends
    * Gary is from the SPDX community. Wanted to check in to see about plans for support SPDX v3. Can’t help with the Golang side, but can help with SPDX spec.
        * SPDX libraries have a PR pending ([#249](https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang/pull/249)) for the v3 spec. Looking for feedback from the Golang community
        * There’s another PR in the repo ([#247](https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang/pull/249)) with an alternative implementation
        * Parth: we’ll take a look at the PRs. That’s the main blocker for adding support in GUAC
