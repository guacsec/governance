## Agenda

* Meeting next week? (MLK holiday in US)
    * Canceled
* Community Meeting on Thursday: [GUAC Community Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImSlr_t3WNZ3zWqpmfqkw1mi6_nkv3enkQ7snWDomKA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.a89kkjlbgpca)
* Data science hackathon at Purdue, write code to solve a challenge
    * Is it easy to create a certifier/collector as a stand alone and then we point to them as 3P certifier.
    * Link: ironhacks.com 
* For the research community, it would be nice to have all these datasets on a central database, and use that as a platform to show how these paper datasets and certifiers translate and run in a current and ongoing dataset?
    * Would help with reporting results of papers in machine ingestible form (and coalesce/merge research results)
    * Having an easy to adopt interface for certifiers would make this very easy to implement
* Make collectors and certifiers easy to implement
* Phillipe runs a session on legal on day 0 at FOSDEM, if we want to present a summary for v2 work. Would be good to share any information on what GUAC is doing. Mike and Jeff will prepare a bulleted list.
* Clearly Defined uses an identifier called a coordinate which precedes PURL, Parth created a go library to convert a PURL to a clearly defined coordinate. Would make sense to pull it out to a separate repo.
